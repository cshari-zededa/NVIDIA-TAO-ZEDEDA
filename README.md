NVIDIA TAO (Transfer, Adapt and Optimize) toolkit offers toolkit to work with pre-trained NVIDIA NGC models, retrain them with additional datasets, optimize the model, and convert them into TensorRT engines for running them using NVIDIA GPUs.

ZEDEDA Edge Orchestrator is an enterprise-grade Edge Management platform and Orchestration Engine that manages lifecyle of Edge workloads, including Edge AI, across thousands of Edge devices distributed across the globe, from a centralized portal. In this demo we are going to see how these two powerful solutions compliment each other, and give a complete Edge AI lifecyle management, right from model development, till the Edge AI solution rollout.

Example notebooks in this repository can be used to get familiar with the End-to-End Edge AI Deveopment and Deployment workflow using NVIDIA TAO Toolkit and ZEDEDA
